## Definition

Self-Encryption key is an AES symmetric key that you own for encrypting data for yourself.

## atPlatform

In the atPlatform, the self-encryption key is used to encrypt data that is stored in your own atServer. It is crucial that this key is kept secret and owned only by you so that third parties like Atsign cannot see your data.

The self-encryption key is generated during the [CRAM](/reference/cram) process when your [PKAM](/reference/pkam) RSA keypair is generated and your [atSign](/reference/atsign) is activated.
